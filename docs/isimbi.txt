ABSTRACT
In the modern digital landscape, cyber threats have become increasingly sophisticated, posing significant risks to organizations and individuals. As networks grow in complexity, traditional security measures often fall short in effectively detecting and mitigating evolving threats. This research focuses on the design and implementation of a comprehensive approach to monitor malicious activities and provide robust network protection. The proposed system integrates multiple security mechanisms, including real-time threat detection, anomaly-based monitoring, and automated incident response. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), the proposed new approach ensures accurate identification of suspicious activities such as unauthorized access attempts, malware propagation, and data exfiltration. Additionally, behavioral analysis techniques are employed to detect deviations from normal network activity, allowing for proactive threat mitigation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated through extensive simulations and real-world testing in controlled network environments. Experimental results demonstrate its capability to detect various forms of cyber threats with high accuracy while maintaining minimal false positives. Moreover, the system proves to be scalable, adaptable, and efficient in protecting networks from both known and emerging threats. In conclusion, this research presents a holistic approach to network security by combining real-time monitoring, threat intelligence, and automated mitigation strategies. The findings contribute to the advancement of cybersecurity frameworks, offering a viable solution for organizations seeking to enhance their network protection against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.






CHAPTER I: GENERAL INTRODUCTION
1.1	INTRODUCTION
This study provides a comprehensive introduction to the study, laying the foundation for the exploration of network protection and malicious activity monitoring. It also highlights the problem statement, emphasizing the limitations of existing detection technologies and the need for advanced intrusion detection systems (IDS) that can address these shortcomings. The objectives of the study are outlined, including the design of a threat monitoring system, the integration of IDS mechanisms. also presents research questions and hypotheses to guide the study, investigating the efficacy of various detection and mitigation techniques. The significance of the study is emphasized, particularly in terms of improving cybersecurity practices, reducing response times to cyber threats. Finally, the chapter outlines the scope of the study, focusing on real-time network monitoring and intrusion detection.
1.2	Background of the study
The Internet communication technology brings great convenience to our society. At the same time, a variety of viruses and malicious codes increasingly spread on the network seriously, it brings growing threats to the network. Among the various forms of malicious software, the Trojan and spyware are most popular in internet. These malwares are always used or programmed by attackers to gain access to private computer systems or gather sensitive information. Trojan and spyware distinguish themselves from other forms of malware, by that, they have to establish a command and control channel to translate command and data. Most of the current malware detection technology runs on one machine and cannot monitor the network layer effectively. (Jiang, 2010)
So such kind of malware detection is not beneficial for detecting the whole local area network (LAN).  Some intrusion detection system (IDS)-based network malware detecting methods, such as Snort , is based on the communication ports and some other known characteristics. These methods do not identify or detect the communication behavior. Thus, these methods are sometimes ineffective with the malicious software that changes the ports dynamically and disguise themselves with protocols. They are also not effective for some unknown malicious software newly created. (Wrightson, 2012)
Modern malware detection requires a more comprehensive approach that extends beyond signature-based methods. Advanced detection techniques, such as anomaly detection and machine learning, offer the potential to identify previously unknown threats by analyzing network behavior, traffic patterns, and system activity in real-time. The integration of behavioral analysis can further enhance detection by identifying deviations from normal user or system behavior that may indicate the presence of malicious activity. (Xiang, 2015)
Additionally, there is a growing need for automated threat mitigation to address the speed and scale of cyberattacks. Manual responses to cyber incidents are often too slow and ineffective, leading to significant damage before a threat can be neutralized. By implementing automated response mechanisms, organizations can quickly isolate compromised devices, block malicious IP addresses, and contain attacks before they can spread further. (Xiang, 2015)
1.2 Problem Statement
In today's digital era, organizations face persistent cyber threats such as malware, phishing, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and unauthorized access. Traditional security measures often fail to detect sophisticated attacks, leading to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. To address these challenges, a comprehensive Network Protection and Malicious Activity Monitoring System is required to continuously monitor, detect, and respond to cyber threats in real-time. The proposed system will leverage advanced security techniques, threat intelligence, and automated response mechanisms to enhance organizational cybersecurity.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction 
This chapter includes the definition of the key concepts used in this study and explores related work in the field. It examines previous research and technology in IoT applications, particularly for systems designed to monitor the bus stand operation.
2.2 RELATED WORKS
Kabiri & Ghorbani (2020) analyzed signature-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) and found them highly effective for detecting known attacks but ineffective against zero-day exploits.Snort and Suricata, popular open-source IDS, use this approach but require frequent signature updates to remain effective. (Ghorbani, 2020)
J. Zhang et al. (2021) explored deep learning-based IDS, demonstrating that autoencoders and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks enhance anomaly detection accuracy. A challenge in anomaly detection is the high false-positive rate, leading to increased alert fatigue among security analysts. (Zhang, 2021)
R. Brown (2020) achieved 94% accuracy in detecting malicious traffic using CNN-based intrusion detection.The computational complexity of deep learning models limits their deployment in resource-constrained environments. (Brown, 2020)
K. Patel et al. (2021) deployed lightweight honeypots to collect botnet attack signatures. These honeypots are effective for basic threat intelligence but cannot capture sophisticated attack behaviors. (Patel, 2021)
M. Ali (2021) explored flow-based DDoS detection, highlighting that NetFlow analytics accurately detect volumetric attacks. However, flow-based monitoring struggles to detect stealthy, low-volume attacks. (Ali, 2021)


2.5 Research gap
Existing network security solutions, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and security information and event management (SIEM) systems, often work in isolation, leading to gaps in real-time threat detection and response. Additionally, many traditional security systems rely on signature-based detection, which fails to identify new and unknown (zero-day) attacks.
Another critical gap lies in the lack of integrated, automated response mechanisms that can proactively mitigate threats without human intervention. Current solutions often detect threats but require manual intervention to neutralize them, which delays response time and increases the risk of successful cyberattacks.
This research aims to address these gaps by designing and implementing a comprehensive network security approach that integrates real-time monitoring, AI-driven anomaly detection, and automated response mechanisms. By bridging the disconnect between threat detection and mitigation, the study seeks to enhance network protection against both known and evolving cyber threats.
2.3 Definition of the key concepts
2.3.1 System Approach
A system approach is a way of solving problems or managing tasks by looking at the entire system as a whole, rather than in isolated parts. It focuses on understanding how all the components interact with each other to achieve a common goal
Network security system approach: A structured, integrated method to address network security as a whole.
2.3.2Threat detection in networking
Threat detection in networking is the process of identifying potential malicious activities or security threats within a computer network. The goal is to spot cyberattacks early, before they can do damage—like stealing data, corrupting files, or taking down systems.
2.3.3 Network protection mechanisms
Network protection mechanisms are the tools, techniques, and strategies used to defend a network from unauthorized access, misuse, and cyber threats. They're the security layers that keep your data, devices, and users safe.
2.3.4 Incident Response
Incident Response is real-time and immediate – it focuses on stopping the threat and minimizing damage.
Digital Forensics is after-the-fact – it dives deep into logs, files, and systems to reconstruct the timeline and gather evidence.

2.3.5 Computer network
A computer network is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. Computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. These interconnections are made up of telecommunications network technologies based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.
2.3.6 Malicious activities in a network
Malicious activities in a network" refers to any intentional actions taken by a cybercriminal to exploit vulnerabilities within a computer network, aiming to gain unauthorized access, steal data, disrupt operations, or cause damage, including activities like malware infections, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and data breaches. 
2.3.7 Network threats 
A network threat refers to any potential activity or event that could harm or interrupt the systems, applications and services operating on a network. These threats can compromise the security of the network by attacking its infrastructure with the primary target usually being information theft or service disruption.
2.3.8 Cyber security
Cyber security is how individuals and organizations reduce the risk of cyber attack. Cyber security's core function is to protect the devices we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers), and the services we access - both online and at work - from theft or damage.

2.3.6 Network integrity
Network Integrity gives you insight into whether users are connecting to an evil twin or suspicious network. Attackers set up evil twin hotspots, which are Wi-Fi access points that an attacker sets up. The fake hotspot imitates a legitimate hotspot, including the primary network name of a nearby business, such as a coffee shop that provides free Wi-Fi access to its customers.
2.3.7 Virus
A computer virus is a type of malicious software, or malware, that spreads between computers and causes damage to data and software

 2.3.8 Spyware
Spyware is malicious software that enters a user's computer, gathers data from the device and user, and sends it to third parties without their consent.
2.4 Some network tools that can be used in network monitoring
a.	Intrusion Detection System (IDS) – Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and generates alerts when potential threats are detected. Examples: Snort, Suricata.
b.	Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) – Similar to IDS, but with the capability to actively block or mitigate detected threats in real-time. Examples: Zeek (formerly Bro), Cisco Firepower.
c.	Firewall – A security system that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules, preventing unauthorized access. Examples: pfSense, iptables, Cisco ASA.
d.	Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System – Collects, analyzes, and correlates security event logs from various sources to provide real-time threat intelligence and incident response. Examples: Splunk, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), IBM QRadar.
